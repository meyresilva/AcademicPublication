# AcademicPublication

In this repository I share my articles published in peer-reviewed journals, 
conference papers, participation in events, courses, workshops. I also make available some manuscripts and works in progress. 


:arrow_right: My research on gender studies started, as in most cases, with an interest in the feminist literature by English and French writers, as **Angela Carter**, **Virginia Woolf** and **Simone Beauvoir**.

:arrow_right: Later on, I was also reading Caribbean writers as Jean Rhys and Jamaica Kincaid and African American writers, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Maya Angelou, and others. My research on African women's writitng happened as a result of this literary journey.
