# Academic Publication

In this repository I share my articles published in peer-reviewed journals, 
conference papers, participation in events, courses, workshops. I also make available some manuscripts and works in progress. 


:arrow_right: My research on gender studies started, as in most cases, with an interest in the feminist literature by English and French writers, as **Angela Carter**, **Virginia Woolf** and **Simone Beauvoir**.

:arrow_right: Later on, I was also interested in the works of Caribbean writers as **Jean Rhys** and **Jamaica Kincaid** and African American writers, **Toni Morrison**, **Alice Walker**, **Maya Angelou**, and others. My research on 
African women's writitng happened as a result of this literary journey.
